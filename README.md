#Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model comparison using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more.

After evaluating multiple models, the best-performing model achieved 73.8% accuracy. The project demonstrates practical ML workflow — from data cleaning to final test submission — and highlights key factors influencing survival rates.
